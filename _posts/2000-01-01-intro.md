# **Ricardo I. Alcalá Briseño**

I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Plant Pathology Department](https://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/), [Institute of Food Systems](http://isfs.institute.ifas.ufl.edu/), and the [Emerging Pathogen Institute](https://www.epi.ufl.edu/) at the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu). I am developing a framework for the analysis of complex viromes in the agroecological landscape supervised by [Karen A. Garrett](https://twitter.com/garret_lab), Preeminent Professor and AAAS fellow. The goal of my dissertation was to assess the virome ecological dynamics in crop systems and its translation to virome management strategies.
I have interested in understanding host-virus interactions, and my long-term goal is to understand virome community assemblage and mechanisms of pathogen emergence in nature. I am developing tools and frameworks for the analysis of complex data sets. I am currently developing a network analysis framework for the study of viral metagenomic sequences, implementing machine learning methods and meta-transcriptomics for sequence quantification. The resulting information is analyzed using a bipartite network analysis combining concepts of island biogeography and community ecology.
