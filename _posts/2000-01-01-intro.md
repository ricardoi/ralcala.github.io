# **Ricardo I. Alcalá Briseño**

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Plant Pathology Department](https://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/) at the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu).
I am investigating viral communities assemblage in the agroecological landscape (*virome landscape*). Also, I am interested in the identification of ecological patterns of viruses.  
The goal of my research is to asses the viral ecological dynamics in crop systems.
