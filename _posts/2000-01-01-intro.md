# **Ricardo I. Alcalá Briseño**

I am a PhD student at the [Plant Pathology Department](https://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/) at the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu).
I am investigating how virome communities are distributed in the agroecological landscape, identifying the viral community patters such as nestedness and modularity, using simulations and statistical analysis.  
The goal of my research is to asses the viral dynamics in crop systems.
